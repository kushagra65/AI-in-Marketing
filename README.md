# AI Marketplace Project

## Project Overview
This project is an AI-driven solution designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of online marketplaces. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques, we aim to address some of the key challenges currently faced by both buyers and sellers in e-commerce platforms. The system integrates various models to enhance customer experience, optimize product offerings, and streamline the search and recommendation process.

## Key Features
- **Image Recognition**: Uses pre-trained models like ResNet50 for recognizing and categorizing products from images, helping users find what they need faster.
- **Clustering & Classification**: Utilizes KMeans and PCA for clustering products based on features, improving organization and search results.
- **Recommendation System**: Employs cosine similarity and deep learning models to provide personalized product recommendations.
- **Data Visualization**: Implements tools like Plotly and Seaborn for visualizing customer trends, product demand, and marketplace performance.

## Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital world, online marketplaces face challenges like inefficient search functionality, irrelevant recommendations, and suboptimal product organization. These issues can result in poor user experiences, decreased customer satisfaction, and reduced sales. Our project aims to solve these problems by:
- Enhancing product discoverability through AI-based image recognition.
- Improving user engagement with personalized recommendations.
- Organizing large product catalogs efficiently through clustering.

## Why This Matters
- **For Customers**: This AI solution allows for a smoother and more intuitive shopping experience, reducing time spent searching for products and increasing the likelihood of finding relevant items.
- **For Sellers**: The AI-driven recommendation and categorization tools help improve product visibility and sales performance by targeting the right customers at the right time.
- **For Marketplace Operators**: The system enhances marketplace functionality, leading to higher customer retention and operational efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For deep learning model development.
- **ResNet50**: A convolutional neural network for image classification tasks.
- **Scikit-learn**: For clustering (KMeans), dimensionality reduction (PCA), and recommendation (cosine similarity).
- **Seaborn & Plotly**: For data visualization.
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing.
